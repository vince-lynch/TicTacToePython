    "## Tic Tac Toe in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Although I've followed stacks of tutorials in Python mainly for Datascience, and Machine Learning and have even built some machine learning applications myself in Python** \n",
    "\n",
    "** I felt as if I have never made a simple game in Python, and as I wanted to re-jig my memory after a long holiday I decided to quickly write a Tic Tac Toe Game, \n",

    "### Computer VS Player\n",
    "\n",
    "With the intention of keeping the logic simple for the WinLogic, and the ComputerMove logic. (so you get to play an advanced player).\n",
    "\n",
    "I came up with the Principle of a defensive move, versus an attack move, and then best moves. with these taking priority in those 3 orders.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far the code below, used a basic version of winLogic with too many if statements that was to be replaced with the closeWin Dictionary - as replacement logic for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a loop that happens after the computer has successfully defended the gameboard. that I need to come back and fix."
