## Tic Tac Toe in Python.

** Although I've followed stacks of tutorials in Python mainly for Datascience, and Machine Learning and have even built some machine learning applications myself in Python** 

** I felt as if I have never made a simple game in Python, and as I wanted to re-jig my memory after a long holiday I decided to quickly write a Tic Tac Toe Game, 

### Computer VS Player

With the intention of keeping the logic simple for the WinLogic, and the ComputerMove logic. (so you get to play an advanced player).

I came up with the Principle of a defensive move, versus an attack move, and then best moves. with these taking priority in those 3 orders.

So far the code below, used a basic version of winLogic with too many if statements that was to be replaced with the closeWin Dictionary - as replacement logic for this.

There is a loop that happens after the computer has successfully defended the gameboard. that I need to come back and fix.
